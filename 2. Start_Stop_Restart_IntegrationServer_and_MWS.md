## 1. Start & Stop Integration Server (IS)

There are multiple ways to start and stop Integration Server:

### 1. **Using Profile Scripts (affects all IS instances)**

* Windows:

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/IS/bin/startup.bat
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/IS/bin/shutdown.bat
  ```
* Linux/Unix:

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/IS/bin/startup.sh
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/IS/bin/shutdown.sh
  ```

ðŸ“Œ Notes:

* When IS starts, two files are created in the same directory: `wrapper.anchor` and `.lock` (hidden).
* If `.lock` is removed (accidentally or due to crash), IS will shut down.
* To restart IS cleanly, delete both files and re-run the startup script.
* These scripts control **all IS instances** in that installation profile.

---

### 2. **Using Instance-level Scripts (affects only one instance)**

* Windows:

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/instances/<instance_name>/bin/startup.bat
  <Installation_Dir>/instances/<instance_name>/bin/shutdown.bat
  ```
* Linux/Unix:

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/instances/<instance_name>/bin/startup.sh
  <Installation_Dir>/instances/<instance_name>/bin/shutdown.sh
  ```

ðŸ“Œ Use this when you want to manage a **specific instance** without affecting others.

---

### 3. **Using IS Admin Console (Web UI)**

* In the IS Admin Console (`http://host:port`), go to the **top-right corner â†’ Shutdown icon**.
* Options available:

  * **Shutdown**
  * **Restart**
  * **Restart in Quiesce mode** (lets running transactions complete before stopping).

ðŸ“Œ This is the most convenient method for administrators working in real time.

---

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Startup / Shutdown Issues

If IS does not start or shuts down unexpectedly, check the following log files:

* `<Installation_Dir>/profiles/IS/logs/wrapper.log` â†’ JVM/service wrapper logs (startup/shutdown errors).
* `<Installation_Dir>/IntegrationServer/logs/server.log` â†’ main server log (service errors, configuration issues).
* `<Installation_Dir>/IntegrationServer/logs/error.log` â†’ critical errors encountered during runtime.

> Tip: If IS hangs during restart, verify that the `.lock` and `wrapper.anchor` files are removed before re-running the startup script.

---

âœ… **Summary:**

* **Profile scripts** â†’ start/stop all IS instances.
* **Instance scripts** â†’ manage one instance only.
* **Admin Console** â†’ web-based shutdown/restart options (including Quiesce).
* **Troubleshooting** â†’ always check `wrapper.log` and `server.log` for issues.
Apologies for the confusion in my earlier responses. Upon reviewing the official documentation, I have updated the information regarding the paths for starting and stopping My webMethods Server (MWS) instances. Please find the corrected content below:

## 2. Start & Stop My webMethods Server (MWS)

There are multiple ways to start and stop My webMethods Server:

### 1. **Using Profile Scripts (Affects All MWS Instances)**

* **Windows:**

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/MWS/bin/startup.bat
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/MWS/bin/shutdown.bat
  ```
* **Linux/Unix:**

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/MWS/bin/startup.sh
  <Installation_Dir>/profiles/MWS/bin/shutdown.sh
  ```

ðŸ“Œ **Notes:**

* These scripts control **all MWS instances** in the specified installation profile.
* Upon starting MWS, two files are created in the same directory: `wrapper.anchor` and `.lock` (hidden).
* If the `.lock` file is removed (accidentally or due to a crash), MWS will shut down.
* To restart MWS cleanly, delete both files and re-run the startup script.

---

### 2. **Using Instance-Level Scripts (Affects Only One Instance)**

* **Windows:**

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/MWS/server/<instance_name>/bin/startup.bat
  <Installation_Dir>/MWS/server/<instance_name>/bin/shutdown.bat
  ```
* **Linux/Unix:**

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/MWS/server/<instance_name>/bin/startup.sh
  <Installation_Dir>/MWS/server/<instance_name>/bin/shutdown.sh
  ```

ðŸ“Œ **Use this method** when you want to manage a **specific MWS instance** without affecting others.

---

### 3. **Using Command-Line Commands for Multiple Instances**

To start, stop, or execute a command on all MWS instances installed on a machine, you can use the following commands:

* **Start All MWS Instances:**

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/MWS/bin/mwsall.bat
  ```
* **Stop All MWS Instances:**

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/MWS/bin/mwsall.bat -stop
  ```
* **Execute a Command on All MWS Instances:**

  ```bash
  <Installation_Dir>/MWS/bin/mwsall.bat -option <command>
  ```

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** These commands are useful when you need to perform operations across all MWS instances simultaneously.

---

### 4. **Using Services (Windows Only)**

If MWS is configured as a Windows service, you can manage it through the Services management console:

1. Open **Control Panel** > **Administrative Tools** > **Services**.
2. Locate the service named `Software AG webMethods MWS`.
3. Right-click the service and choose **Start**, **Stop**, or **Restart** as needed.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This method is applicable only if MWS has been set up as a service during installation.

---

### 5. **Using MWS Administrator Console (Web UI)**

You can also manage MWS directly from the MWS Administrator Console:

1. Access the MWS Administrator Console via a web browser:
   `http://<host>:<port>/mws`
2. Log in with appropriate credentials.
3. Navigate to the **System Management** section.
4. Use the available options to **start**, **stop**, or **restart** MWS.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** The availability of these options may depend on the permissions assigned to your user account.

---

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Startup / Shutdown Issues

If MWS does not start or shuts down unexpectedly, check the following log files:

* `<Installation_Dir>/profiles/MWS/logs/wrapper.log` â†’ JVM/service wrapper logs (startup/shutdown errors).
* `<Installation_Dir>/MWS/server/<instance_name>/logs/server.log` â†’ main server log (service errors, configuration issues).
* `<Installation_Dir>/MWS/server/<instance_name>/logs/error.log` â†’ critical errors encountered during runtime.

ðŸ“Œ **Tip:** If MWS hangs during restart, verify that the `.lock` and `wrapper.anchor` files are removed before re-running the startup script.

---

âœ… **Summary:**

* **Profile scripts** â†’ start/stop all MWS instances.
* **Instance scripts** â†’ manage one instance only.
* **Command-line commands** â†’ perform operations across all MWS instances.
* **Services (Windows only)** â†’ manage MWS as a Windows service.
* **Admin Console** â†’ web-based management options (if available).
* **Troubleshooting** â†’ always check `wrapper.log` and `server.log` for issues.
