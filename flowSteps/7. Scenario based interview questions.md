## 1. Loop with Conditional Processing

**Q:** You have a list of 100 purchase order items. You need to validate each item and send a notification only for invalid items. How would you design it using Flow steps?  

**A:**  
- Use a **LOOP step** to iterate over purchase order items.  
- Inside the loop, use a **BRANCH step** to check item validity.  
  - **Valid branch:** Do nothing or log success.  
  - **Invalid branch:** Use **INVOKE step** to send notification.  
- Use **OUTPUT array** if you want to collect all invalid items for reporting.  
- Use **TRY-CATCH** inside the loop to handle failures for each item without stopping the loop.

---

## 2. Retry Logic

**Q:** You are invoking an external web service that sometimes fails due to network issues. How would you implement a retry mechanism?  

**A:**  
- Use a **REPEAT step** around the **INVOKE step**.  
- Set the maximum number of retries and include a condition to stop if the call succeeds.  
- Optionally, include a **WAIT step** to pause between retries.  
- Use **TRY-CATCH** to log errors after retries fail.

---

## 3. Conditional Exit

**Q:** While looping over a list of transactions, you want to stop processing as soon as a transaction fails validation. How do you implement this?  

**A:**  
- Use a **LOOP step** for the transaction list.  
- Inside the loop, validate the transaction.  
- If validation fails, use an **EXIT step** with a label pointing to the loop to break out immediately.  
- Log the failed transaction for reporting.

---

## 4. Sequential Updates

**Q:** You have multiple dependent database updates that must execute in order. How would you design it?  

**A:**  
- Use a **SEQUENCE step** to group the database update steps.  
- Each step executes one after another, ensuring order is maintained.  
- Use **TRY-CATCH** around the SEQUENCE to handle failures and rollback if needed.

---

## 5. Complex Branching

**Q:** You need to route orders based on country and order amount. How would you implement it?  

**A:**  
- Use a **BRANCH step** to first check the country.  
- Inside each branch, use a **nested BRANCH** to check order amount thresholds.  
- Call appropriate services using **INVOKE steps** based on the conditions.  
- Use **COMMENT or TRACE steps** for debugging and documentation.

---

## 6. Collecting Loop Output

**Q:** After processing items in a loop, you need a list of processed IDs for reporting. How do you implement it?  

**A:**  
- Use **LOOP step** to process items.  
- Set **Output array** property to collect processed item IDs.  
- After the loop, the output array contains all IDs for reporting or further processing.

---

## 7. Exception Handling in Loop

**Q:** While iterating through orders, one order may fail due to missing data. How do you prevent the loop from stopping?  

**A:**  
- Use a **TRY-CATCH step** inside the loop.  
- TRY contains the processing steps.  
- CATCH handles exceptions for that order, logs error, and continues to the next iteration.

---

## 8. Dynamic Branching

**Q:** You need to process different services dynamically based on an input parameter. How would you implement it?  

**A:**  
- Use a **BRANCH step** with conditions based on the input parameter.  
- Each branch **INVOKEs** a different service.  
- Use **LABELS** if you need to combine with **EXIT steps** for dynamic control.

---

## 9. Retry with Timeout

**Q:** A service call must retry up to 5 times or until it succeeds, but each attempt should timeout if it takes more than 10 seconds. How do you design it?  

**A:**  
- Wrap the **INVOKE step** in a **REPEAT step** with maximum 5 iterations.  
- Use the **Timeout property** on the INVOKE step or child service to limit each call to 10 seconds.  
- Use **TRY-CATCH** to handle failures after retries.

---

## 10. Cleanup After Exception

**Q:** You perform multiple updates in a flow. If any step fails, you want to log the error and perform cleanup. How?  

**A:**  
- Use **TRY-CATCH-FINALLY**:  
  - **TRY:** Perform updates.  
  - **CATCH:** Log error details.  
  - **FINALLY:** Perform cleanup operations like closing resources or resetting variables.

---

## 11. Nested Loop Scenario

**Q:** You have orders with multiple items. Each item has multiple serial numbers to process. How would you implement nested iteration?  

**A:**  
- Outer **LOOP step**: Iterate through orders.  
- Inner **LOOP step**: Iterate through items’ serial numbers.  
- Include **TRY-CATCH** inside inner loop to handle serial-level exceptions.  
- Collect results in **output arrays** at each level.

---

## 12. Conditional Loop Exit

**Q:** Stop processing a list of invoices if the total amount exceeds a limit. How?  

**A:**  
- Use a **LOOP step** for invoices.  
- Inside, check if the total exceeds the limit.  
- If yes, use **EXIT step** to break the loop immediately.  
- Optionally log or notify about the exit condition.

---

## 13. Logging Flow Execution

**Q:** You want to monitor values in loops and branches without affecting execution. How?  

**A:**  
- Use **TRACE step** inside loops and branches.  
- Log important pipeline variables per iteration or branch execution.  
- Use **COMMENT step** to document the logic for maintainability.

---

## 14. Batch Processing

**Q:** Process large data in batches of 50 using Flow Steps. How?  

**A:**  
- Use **LOOP step** to iterate over full dataset.  
- Use **MAP or pipeline logic** to create sublists of 50 items.  
- Process each batch inside the loop.  
- Collect results in an **output array**.

---

## 15. Multiple Conditional Exits

**Q:** A loop may exit under multiple conditions: validation fail or inventory limit reached. How to implement?  

**A:**  
- Inside **LOOP step**, use **BRANCH step** to evaluate multiple conditions.  
- Use **EXIT step** with label pointing to the loop for each condition.

---

## 16. Sequential Service Execution with Error Handling

**Q:** You need multiple services executed sequentially, but continue if one fails. How?  

**A:**  
- Use **SEQUENCE step** to group services.  
- Use **TRY-CATCH inside each service** or **at sequence level** to handle failures.  
- Log errors and continue execution.

---

## 17. Conditional Retry

**Q:** Retry a failed operation only if failure type is "NetworkError". How?  

**A:**  
- Use **REPEAT step** around INVOKE step.  
- In **CATCH step**, evaluate failure type.  
- Only retry if condition matches "NetworkError".

---

## 18. Output Aggregation in Nested Loops

**Q:** Aggregate processed item IDs from nested loops for final reporting. How?  

**A:**  
- Inner **LOOP** collects IDs into an inner output array.  
- Outer **LOOP** aggregates inner arrays into a master output array for reporting.

---

## 19. Handling Optional Input Arrays

**Q:** Input array may sometimes be empty. How to design a loop safely?  

**A:**  
- Use **BRANCH step** before LOOP to check if array exists and has elements.  
- Only execute LOOP if the array is not empty.

---

## 20. Complex Conditional Workflow

**Q:** Route orders for different processing based on country, amount, and customer type. How?  

**A:**  
- Use **nested BRANCH steps** for each condition.  
- Execute appropriate INVOKE steps for each combination.  
- Use **TRACE steps** to log decisions and outputs.
