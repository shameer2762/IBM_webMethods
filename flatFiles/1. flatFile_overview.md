# ðŸ§¾ Flat Files in webMethods

## **Definition**
A **Flat File** in webMethods is a **text-based file format** that stores data in a **structured but plain-text form**, typically using **delimiters** (like commas, tabs, or pipes) or **fixed-width fields** to separate individual data elements.  
It is commonly used for **data exchange between heterogeneous systems** where complex data formats (like XML or JSON) are not supported.

## **Flat File Components in webMethods**
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Flat File Dictionary (.ffdic)** | Defines individual record structures and field definitions. |
| **Flat File Schema (.ffs)** | Specifies the hierarchical structure of the flat file (records, field orders, delimiters, etc.). |
| **Flat File Structure (Runtime)** | Used by flow services for parsing or converting flat files. |

## **Real-Time Use Case Example**
**Scenario:**  
A bank sends daily transaction reports as `.csv` files.  
- Each record contains fields like *Account Number, Name, Transaction Type, Amount*.  
- webMethods reads the file from an FTP location, parses it using the defined schema, maps data to the internal structure, and loads it into the target application or database.
