# 🧾 Record With ID vs Record With No ID (in webMethods Flat File Schema)

| Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Record With ID** | Each record in the flat file has a **unique identifier** (like `HDR`, `DTL`, `TRL`) that tells webMethods which record definition to use. Used when file contains **multiple record types**. | Example file:<br>`HDR:1001:2025-10-21`<br>`DTL:1001:ItemA:10`<br>`TRL:1001:2:300`<br>➡ In schema, choose **Record Identifier = Yes**, define record IDs `HDR`, `DTL`, `TRL`. |
| **Record With No ID** | File **does not contain any record identifier**. All records follow **same structure**. You define a **default record** (often called `recordWithNoID`). | Example file:<br>`1001,2025-10-21,John,USA`<br>`1002,2025-10-22,Jane,UK`<br>➡ In schema, choose **Record Identifier = No** and set one record as **Default Record**. |

### ✅ Key Points
- **Use Record With ID** → when file has tags to identify record type.  
- **Use Record With No ID** → when all records are same or no tags exist.  
- In Designer, the “Select Record Identifier” option decides which approach you use.  
- When “No ID” is selected, set a **Default Record** in the schema to parse all lines correctly.


# 📘 Understanding the "Record With No ID" Concept in webMethods Flat File Schema

## 🔹 Overview
When creating a **Flat File Schema** in **webMethods Designer**, the handling of record identifiers determines whether the schema treats the data as **Record With ID** or **Record With No ID**.

One important property in this configuration is the **Set** button (under the **Properties** section of the schema).  
This property allows you to assign a **Default Record** — which directly impacts whether your document is generated as `recordWithNoID`.

---

## 🔹 Official Documentation Reference
According to the [IBM webMethods Designer documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/webmethods-integration/wm-designer/11.1.0?topic=files-creating-flat-file-schemas):

> “If your flat file does not contain record identifiers, you must select a default record.  
> By selecting a default record, a CSV file can be parsed as a special case of record with no record identifier.”

This means:
- When **no record identifier** is present, the schema must have a **Default Record** selected.
- The **Set** property is used to choose this default record from a referenced dictionary.

---

## ⚙️ Behavior Explanation

| Scenario | Configuration | Result |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Record With No ID** | Use the **Set (Default Record)** property and refer to a record definition from a dictionary. | The parser assumes all incoming lines follow the same record structure. The generated document will include `recordWithNoID`. |
| **Record With ID** | Do **not** set a Default Record. Instead, define record identifiers in the **Flat File Structure** tab or choose **Record Identifier = Yes** during creation. | The parser expects each record to have an identifier and maps lines to the appropriate record definitions. |

---

## 🔹 Example Scenario

- **Case 1 – Record With No ID**
  - File lines are uniform, no unique tag per line.
  - In the schema, select **Record Identifier = No**.
  - Use the **Set** button to assign a default record from your dictionary.
  - The generated IS document type will contain a structure named `recordWithNoID`.

- **Case 2 – Record With ID**
  - File contains tags like `HDR`, `DTL`, or `TRL`.
  - In the schema, select **Record Identifier = Yes** and define how to extract the identifier (Nth field or position).
  - The parser applies the matching record definition for each record type.

---

## 🧩 Why It Matters
- The **Set (Default Record)** property acts as a switch between **Record With ID** and **Record With No ID** modes.  
- If no Default Record is set and no record identifier is configured, the parser cannot determine which record definition to use and may throw parsing errors.  
- Using a Default Record ensures that delimited or CSV files without identifiers can still be parsed successfully.

---

## ⚠️ Notes from IBM Documentation
- *“If the default record is not specified, unrecognized records are placed into the output which might produce errors.”*  
- Even with a default record, your record definitions and field extractors must still align correctly with the flat file structure.  
- If the file contains multiple logical record types but lacks identifiers, pre-processing or separate schemas may be required.

---

## ✅ Summary
- Use **Set (Default Record)** → for *Record With No ID* files.  
- Skip **Set** and define record identifiers → for *Record With ID* files.  
- The **Set** property ensures uniform files without tags are parsed as `recordWithNoID`.  
- This behavior aligns with how webMethods Integration Server treats unidentified records in a schema.
